# Overview
This is a simple utility to upload media files from the backend to AWS, it uses the [aws-sdk](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3) package to upload files to AWS S3.

## Why?
Why does this exist? Well, I wanted to learn how to use AWS S3, and I wanted to learn how to use TypeScript, so I decided to combine the two and make a simple utility to upload files to AWS S3.
